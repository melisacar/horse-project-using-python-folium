# The Sea of Marmara Mapping - Realted Researches

- This project focuses on a comprehensive literature review of academic studies published between 2020 and 2024 on the Marmara Sea. The primary goal is to systematically examine and archive theses, articles, and other academic sources published during this period. This work aims to present the existing literature in a well-organized and accessible format for scientists and researchers planning to study the Sea of Marmara.


## Explore the Heatmap
- **Visualize Research Concentration:** The heatmap provides a visual representation of the density and distribution of research activities related to the Sea of Marmara.
- **Interactive Map:** Click 'here' to explore the heatmap, where you can see areas with higher research activity.

## Features
- **Heatmap Visualization:** Displays the concentration of research on the Marmara Sea using a heatmap.
- **Python-Powered:** Built using Python and the Folium library to create and customize the heatmap map.

## Installation
1. Clone the Repo
```shell
git clone https://github.com/melisacar/horse-project-using-python-folium.git
cd .\regional-heat-map-project\
```

2. Set Up the Environment
- Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Then install the necessary packages using requirements.txt:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Script
- Generate the map by running:
```shell
python main.py
```

4. View the Map
- Open the generated HTML file in your web browser to view the interactive map:
```shell
start heat_map.html  # Windows
open heat_map.html  # macOS
xdg-open heat_map.html  # Linux
```

## Dependencies
1. Python 3.x
2. Folium: To create and render interactive maps.

## Future Improvements:
- Expand dataset:
  - [ ] Include publications from before 2020
- Enhance heatmap features:
    - [ ] Add more interactive elements
    - [ ] Improve map style and design
